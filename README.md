# Arduino-Sensor-System
A system that reads sensor data using Arduino and controls actuators such as LEDs and buzzers. In this project, data from various sensors are displayed on a screen, and feedback is provided via LEDs/buzzers. The project aims to provide experience in basic Arduino programming and hardware integration.
